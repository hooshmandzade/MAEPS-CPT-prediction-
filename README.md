# MAEPS-CPT-prediction-
This project builds a data-driven pipeline that assigns a lithostratigraphic label to every depth sample in Cone Penetration Test (CPT) profiles across Flanders and quantifies the uncertainty of each label. We treat each CPT as a depth-ordered sequence of signals (e.g., qc, fs, derived features), train per-depth and sequence-aware models, and evaluate with spatially robust splits (DBSCAN blocks + buffer) to avoid leakage. Predictions—with calibrated probabilities and top-k alternatives—are designed for a human-in-the-loop viewer so geologists can quickly accept, adjust, or overrule, and their edits feed back for active learning. Success is measured by per-depth accuracy/F1, boundary error (cm), calibration (ECE), and reduction of artifacts in downstream 3D subsurface models.
